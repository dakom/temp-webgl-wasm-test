[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dakom/temp-webgl-wasm-test.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dakom/temp-webgl-wasm-test)

Currently just for testing Spector

The Rust/Wasm part was built separately to keep things simple for diagnosis here. 

Its only purpose is to call the WebGL API to create a red square in the top-right quadrant.
